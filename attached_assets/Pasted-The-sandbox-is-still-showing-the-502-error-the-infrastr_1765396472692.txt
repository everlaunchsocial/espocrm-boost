The sandbox is still showing the 502 error (the infrastructure issue you mentioned you're working on in another chat). I can't take a live screenshot right now, but let me review the code changes I made so you can evaluate the design:

## Code Review: "Preview Your AI" Card

Here's what I implemented for the Customer Dashboard:

### ✅ **What's Good**

| Feature | Implementation |
|---------|---------------|
| **Visual Hierarchy** | Gradient background (`from-primary/5 via-background to-primary/10`) makes the card stand out |
| **Bot Icon** | Rounded icon container with `Bot` icon creates visual identity |
| **Clear Title** | "Test Your AI Assistant" - action-oriented |
| **Helpful Description** | Explains both chat and phone testing options |
| **Responsive Layout** | `flex-col sm:flex-row` stacks on mobile, side-by-side on desktop |
| **Large Buttons** | `size="lg"` for easy tapping on mobile |

### ✅ **Two Clear Actions**

1. **Open Chat Preview** → Links to `/customer/preview`
   - Primary button with Play icon
   - Goes to the full chat/voice preview page

2. **Phone Section** (conditional):
   - **If phone provisioned**: Shows phone number in a styled card with green phone icon and clickable `tel:` link
   - **If no phone yet**: Shows "Get Phone Number" outline button linking to `/customer/settings/deploy`

### 📍 **Placement**

The card appears right after the `` component - making it highly visible at the top of the dashboard, before usage stats and recent leads.

### 🤔 **Potential Improvements to Consider**

1. **Add Voice Preview Button?** - The preview page has both chat AND voice. Should we add a direct "Start Voice Call" button that opens the preview page with voice mode active?

2. **Show AI Status?** - Could display whether the AI is "Live" or "Setup Needed" based on onboarding completion

3. **Animation** - Could add a subtle pulse or glow to draw attention for new customers

Once the 502 server issue is resolved in your other chat, you'll be able to see this card live on `/customer/dashboard`. Would you like me to make any adjustments to the design?
